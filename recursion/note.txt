Linear Recursion: If function calling itself only one time then it is linear recursion.
Tree Recursion : If a function calling itself multiple times then it is called tree recursion.  
Types of Recursion
1.Tail Recursion
2.Head Recursion
3.Tree Recursion
4.Indirect Recursion
5.Nested Recursion=>fn(fn(n-1)*n);


* Recursion in local variable behaviour and Recursion in static or global variable behaviour are different.
1. Tail Recursion: if a recursion call is in last statement of a recursion function then it called tail recursion. Tail recursion doesn perform anything at all at returning time;

2.Head Recursion: if a recursion call is in fast statement of a recursion function then it called head recursion.
3. Tree Recursion: more than two recursion call
4. Indirect Recursion : If the situation is like function A call function B and function B call function C and the finally C all function A then it is known as Indirect recursion.
